You get closer and realize that the gate has been forced open.

A hole is blown through a hallway connecting the munitions storage to another building. You see silhouettes of soldiers firing and advancing through the smoke.\n\nA lightbulb fires up in your head. That hole would be the perfect way to enter the building, and hopefully find a bunker of sorts, with enough supplies to last the apocalypse. It is a military base, after all.")

EVACTUATION HELICOPTERS HAVE BEEN CALLED TO SECTOR 4. IF YOU DO NOT EVACUATE, YOU WILL BE LEFT BEHIND.\nI REPEAT, AN AIR STRIKE HAS BEEN ORDERED ON THIS BASE IN T-60 MINUTES. EVACTUATION HELICOPTERS HAVE BEEN CALLED TO SECTOR 4. IF YOU DO NOT EVACUATE, YOU WILL BE LEFT BEHIND.\"\n\nYour heart sinks.

Opening it reveales another hallway, with 2 metal pocket doors at the end. They seem to be powered by hydraulics.\n\nOne of them is slightly ajar, while the other one is shut.")
